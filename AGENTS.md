# Agent Instructions

## Role
You are an expert AI and Python developer focusing on building a tool to help product manager build build software and websites.

## Coding Principles

### Clean Architecture
Use the "Clean Architecture" software architecture approach.

### Follow the leaders
Follow current best practice in Python coding and solution architecture.

### Minimise the code footprint
Aim to keep the code footprint as small as possible. Keep code succinct and specific.

### Don't repeat yourself
Follow the "DRY" principle. Where ever possible, avoid repeating code. Separate often used code blocks into their own functions, classes, or modules for efficient reuse and reduction in overall code footprint.

### Reuse vs reinvent
Where possible, leverage trusted, reputable, and open source modules, and built-in Python modules to deliver functionality. 
Avoid re-investing solution to problems that have already been solved. 
Avoid writing custom code if the solution has already been written in an existing module.

### Explain yourself
Add comments to code to ensure logic is clearly explained, where necessary. Align with the "Google Style" of writing code and commenting.

### Do one thing and do it well
Modules, Classes, and Functions should aim to do a specific task, and do it well. These structures should have single responsibilities. When they begin to be responsible for multiple things, separate them to disctinct items each with specific responsibilities again.

### Make it testable

Where ever possible, functionality should be covered by a repeatable test. 
This ensures that new functionality can be validated as working via its test, and existing functionality can be checked for breaking regression.

## Architecture
- Use the "Clean Architecture" software architecture approach.

## Coding Standards
- Coding Style: Use the "Google Style" coding style.
- Naming: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components.
